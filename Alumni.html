            Text messaging, or texting, is the act of composing
             and sending electronic messages, typically consisting of alphabetic and numeric characters, between two or more users of mobile devices, desktops/laptops, or other type of compatible computer. Text messages may be sent over a cellular network, or 
             may also be sent via an Internet connection.
            The term originally referred to messages sent
             using the Short Message Service (SMS). It has
              grown beyond alphanumeric text to include 
              multimedia messages (known as MMS) containing 
              digital images, videos, and sound content, as 
              well as ideograms known as emoji (happy faces,
               sad faces, and other icons).
            
            As of 2017, text messages are used by youth and
             adults for personal, family, business and social
              purposes. Governmental and non-governmental
               organizations use text messaging for 
               communication between colleagues. In the 2010s,
                the sending of short informal messages has 
            become an accepted part of many cultures, 
            as happened earlier with emailing.[1] 
            This makes texting a quick and easy way to
             communicate with friends, family and coll
             eagues, including in contexts where a call
             impolite or inappropriate (e.g., calling very
              late at night or when one knows the other person
               is busy with family or work activities). Like 
               e-mail and voicemail, and unlike calls (in which
                the caller hopes to speak directly with the recipient), texting does not require the caller and recipient to both be free at the same moment; this permits communication even between busy individuals. Text messages can also be used to interact with automated systems, for example, to order products or services from e-commerce websites, or to participate in online contests. Advertisers a
                nd service providers use dire
